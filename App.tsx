// This file previously contained the main application component,
// including routing (HashRouter) and global layout structure.
// With the migration to Next.js App Router:
// - Routing is handled by the 'app' directory structure.
// - Global layout, including AuthProvider and ErrorBoundary,
//   is now managed in 'app/layout.tsx'.
// This file is no longer the primary application shell.
